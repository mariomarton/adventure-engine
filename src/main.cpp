Adventure Engine
Text-based RPG Engine
by MÃ¡rio Marton

*** 	Character creation

When the player starts a game made in AdventureEngine, they first make choices that will affect their character.

Firstly, the game displays information about the possible types of the main character. The player then chooses one. For example "warrior" or "intellectual" .

Secondly, the game shows a list of attributes. Each of them is set to 100% by default. However, the player then has a chance to increase these values by N percentage points. For example, in a game with N=20 and three attributes - health, power, intelligence - the player could choose values 110%, 104%, 106% .

When the player performs an action in the game, the game can respond differently to the same action depeding on the player's attributes.
If the player meets the required attributes the game prints the main text response, otherwise it prints an alternative one.
Attributes are influenced by both player's choice of the percentages and by the chosen Type.




***		InventoryStorage/Storage system

The main character has an inventory. It is implemented as a set of Storage objects. Besides the standard "Main character storage" (their hands, pockets), the InventoryStorage can contain "External storages" like bags, backpacks etc. The game also includes Room Storages - one for each room - these are unrelated to InventoryStorage.

Each Storage has a limited capacity.
The player can take and remove items from/to InventoryStorage.




*** 	Combat system

The engine features non-playable characters and a combat system. If an NPC is "fightable", then the player can attack it.
The player can have Objects in their two hands. If an object is a weapon and it's in a hand, it can be used for combat.

The weapon (or no weapon) that will be used for the combat is determined by the engine once the player wants to start combat.
It calculates the power of the possible weapon in left/right hand and the power of using no weapon, and then choses the most effective option.

The player can add or remove objects from their two hands before combat to get ready, however (Currently not implemented.)




*** 	Saving / Loading

The player can both save the game and load a save-file.
The engine currently supports the saving/loading of:
	- the current room
	- the Main Character's attributes values
	- the Main Character's Type




*** 	Configuration

The game creator creates a game using JSON configuration files.

Each game is in a separate directory in ./example.
	Each game's root directory must include:
		- 3 .json files:
			- commands.json
			- types-and-attributes.json
			- game-setup.json
		- and 4 subdirectories: /events, /rooms, /inventory, /saves


The game creator can get inspired by the working example games in the ./example directory.
The keys and values must follow the same syntax as these example files.
The key strings contain hints and expanations on how they work.




*** 	Inheritence & Polymorphism

Inheritence:
	- Storage is the parent class of
		- Main Character Storage
		- External Storage
		- Room Storage
	- GameEntity is the parent class of
		- GameObject
		- MainCharacter
		- NPC

Polymorphism:
	- One of the most important containers of this project is the map called "entities" in Game class.
		- std::unordered_map< std::string, std::shared_ptr<GameEntity> > entities
		- it maps names and synonym names (std::string) to GameEntity objects.
		- Game class further includes methods for manipulation with the map
			- std::shared_ptr<GameEntity> Game::findEntity(const std::string& noun) const
			- bool Game::addNamesToEntityMap(const std::vector<std::string>& names, GameEntity& entity)
			- void Game::removeEntityFromMap(GameEntity& entityToBeRemoved)

	- InventoryStorage contains Storages (one InventoryStorage and O...N ExternalStorages)
		-	It's methods using Polymorphism, therefore using the Storage class include:
			- bool addExternalStorage(Storage& storage);
			- bool removeStorage(const Storage& storage);
			- bool addObject(std::shared_ptr<GameObject> object, Storage& storage);
			- bool removeOneObject(std::shared_ptr<GameObject> object, Storage& storage);
			- bool removeAllObjects(std::shared_ptr<GameObject> object, Storage& storage);
			- const std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ExternalStorage>>& getExternalStorages() const;

	- Finding out how many (if any) instances of an entity are in Storage uses polymorphism:
		- unsigned int getEntityCount(const GameEntity& object) const
		- This method gets called when the player enters the Verb/Noun pair.
		  At that point we don't know what type of GameEntity the Noun could refer to, so the GameEntity parent class is used in the method.
